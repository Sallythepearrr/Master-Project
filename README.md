## The Relation of Pupil Dynamics with Task Performance and Ongoing Fluctuations of Neuronal Activity in Superior Colliculus in Visual Detection Tasks

My master's project involves analysis of mice's behavioural data in the visual contrast detection task (Ruediger and Scanziani, 2020).
The second part of the project includes the analysis of neuronal and behavioural data in the image-change detection task (Visual Behavior Neuropixels, Allen Institute).
